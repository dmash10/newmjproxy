## 🚀 Quick Deployment Options

### Option 1: One-Click Deploy (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account
# 2. Go to railway.app and create new project
# 3. Connect your GitHub repo
# 4. Set environment variables in Railway dashboard
# 5. Deploy automatically
```

### Option 2: Railway CLI
```bash
# Run the automated deployment script
./deploy-to-railway.sh
```

### Option 3: Manual Setup
1. Install Railway CLI: `npm install -g @railway/cli`
2. Login: `railway login`
3. Initialize: `railway init`
4. Set variables: `railway variables set KEY=value`
5. Deploy: `railway up`

## ⚙️ Required Environment Variables

Set these in your Railway dashboard:

```env
# Required
DISCORD_GUILD_ID=your_discord_server_id
DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID=your_discord_channel_id
DISCORD_USER_TOKEN=your_discord_user_token
MJ_API_SECRET=your_secure_api_secret

# Optional (with defaults)
SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=railway
MJ_CORE_SIZE=3
MJ_QUEUE_SIZE=10
MJ_TIMEOUT_MINUTES=5
MJ_TASK_STORE_TYPE=in_memory
MJ_TRANSLATE_WAY=null
```

## 🔍 Testing Your Deployment

After deployment, test your API:

```bash
# Make the test script executable
chmod +x test-api.sh

# Run tests
./test-api.sh https://your-app.railway.app your-api-secret
```

## 📊 Key Features & Optimizations

### 🏗️ Build Optimizations
- **Multi-stage Docker build** - Reduces final image size by ~60%
- **Dependency caching** - Faster rebuilds when only code changes
- **Skip tests** - Faster deployment (tests can be run in CI/CD)

### 🚀 Runtime Optimizations
- **G1 Garbage Collector** - Better performance for cloud environments
- **String deduplication** - Reduced memory usage
- **Optimized heap settings** - 75% max RAM usage for Railway containers
- **Health checks** - Automatic restart on failures

### 🔒 Security Enhancements
- **Environment variables** - No secrets in code
- **API authentication** - Required for all endpoints
- **Secure defaults** - Production-ready configuration

### 📈 Monitoring & Observability
- **Health endpoint** - `/health` for Railway monitoring
- **Metrics endpoint** - `/actuator/metrics` for performance monitoring
- **Structured logging** - Better log analysis in Railway dashboard
- **Request/response logging** - Debug API issues

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Fails**
   ```bash
   # Check Railway build logs
   railway logs --deployment
   ```

2. **App Won't Start**
   ```bash
   # Check runtime logs
   railway logs
   ```

3. **Discord Connection Issues**
   - Verify Discord token is valid
   - Check server/channel IDs
   - Ensure Midjourney bot is in your server

4. **API Authentication Fails**
   - Verify `MJ_API_SECRET` environment variable
   - Check request headers include `mj-api-secret`

### Debug Mode
Enable verbose logging:
```bash
railway variables set SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=railway,debug
```

## 📚 API Documentation

Once deployed, access interactive API docs at:
`https://your-app.railway.app/doc.html`

### Key Endpoints
- `GET /health` - Health check
- `GET /mj/task/list` - List all tasks
- `POST /mj/submit/imagine` - Submit imagine request
- `GET /mj/task/{id}/fetch` - Get task status
- `POST /mj/submit/action` - Submit action (upscale, variation, etc.)

## 💰 Cost Estimation

Railway pricing for typical usage:
- **Free tier**: $5 credit/month (good for testing)
- **Light usage**: $10-15/month (occasional use)
- **Medium usage**: $20-30/month (regular use)
- **Heavy usage**: $40-60/month (high volume)

## 🔄 Updates & Maintenance
